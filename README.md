# SalesApp
This Project Introduces Sales Management System.
Our project helps shopkeepers in performing safe transactions and all the records are kept in an centralized environment on a PC using MySQL DBMS.
Our project have a window in which all the list of items are provided for purchasing any item for the customers which in turn shows total amount to be paid and produces a bill for the given transaction. 
There is another window in which shopkeeper can import the items which are empty by selecting them from the list and similarly it provides total amount and keeps a record of imports in database.
